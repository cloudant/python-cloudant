    Provides a context manager to create a Cloudant session and
    provide access to databases, docs etc.

    :param str user: Username used to connect to Cloudant.
    :param str passwd: Authentication token used to connect to Cloudant.
    :param str account: The Cloudant account name.  If the account parameter
        is present, it will be used to construct the Cloudant service URL.
    :param str url: If the account is not present and the url parameter is
        present then it will be used to set the Cloudant service URL.  The
        url must be a fully qualified http/https URL.
    :param str x_cloudant_user: Override the X-Cloudant-User setting used to
        authenticate. This is needed to authenticate on one's behalf,
        eg with an admin account.  This parameter must be accompanied
        by the url parameter.  If the url parameter is omitted then
        the x_cloudant_user parameter setting is ignored.
    :param str encoder: Optional json Encoder object used to encode
        documents for storage. Defaults to json.JSONEncoder.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        from cloudant import cloudant

        with cloudant(USERNAME, PASSWORD, account=ACCOUNT_NAME) as client:
