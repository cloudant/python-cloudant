class Query(dict):
    """
    Encapsulates a query as a dictionary based object, providing a sliceable
    and iterable query result collection that can be used to process query
    output data through the ``result`` attribute.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Slicing to skip/limit:
        query.result[100:200]
        query.result[:200]
        query.result[100:]
        query.result[:]

        # Iteration is supported via the result attribute:
        for doc in query.result:
            print doc

    The query ``result`` collection provides basic functionality,
    which can be customized with other arguments using the
    :func:`~cloudant.query.Query.custom_result` context.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Setting the read quorum as part of a custom result
        with query.custom_result(r=3) as rslt:
            rslt[100:200] # slice the result

            # Iteration
            for doc in rslt:
                print doc

        # Iteration over a query result sorted by the "name" field:
        with query.custom_result(sort=[{'name': 'asc'}]) as rslt:
            for doc in rslt:
                print doc

    :param CloudantDatabase database: A Cloudant database instance used by the
        Query.
    :param str bookmark: A string that enables you to specify which page of
        results you require. Only valid for queries using indexes of type
        *text*.
    :param list fields: A list of fields to be returned by the query.
    :param int limit: Maximum number of results returned.
    :param int r: Read quorum needed for the result.  Each document is read from
        at least 'r' number of replicas before it is returned in the results.
    :param str selector: Dictionary object describing criteria used to select
        documents.
    :param int skip: Skip the first 'n' results, where 'n' is the value
        specified.
    :param list sort: A list of fields to sort by.  Optionally the list can
        contain elements that are single member dictionary structures that
        specify sort direction.  For example ``sort=['name', {'age': 'desc'}]``
        means to sort the query results by the "name" field in ascending order
        and the "age" field in descending order.
    :param str use_index: Identifies a specific index for the query to run
        against, rather than using the Cloudant Query algorithm which finds
        what it believes to be the best index.

        Makes the Query object callable and retrieves the raw JSON content
        from the remote database based on the current Query definition,

        .. code-block:: python

        Note:  Rather than using the Query callable directly, if you wish to
        retrieve query results in raw JSON format use the provided database API
        of :func:`~cloudant.database.CouchDatabase.get_query_result`
        and set ``raw_result=True`` instead.
