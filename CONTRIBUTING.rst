Developing this library
=======================

Python-Cloudant Client Library is written in Python.

Contributor License Agreement
=============================

In order for us to accept pull-requests, the contributor must first complete
a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This clarifies the intellectual
property license granted with any contribution. It is for your protection as a
Contributor as well as the protection of IBM and its customers; it does not
change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

This is a quick process: one option is signing using Preview on a Mac,
then sending a copy to us via email.

You can download the CLAs here:

- `Corporate <http://cloudant.github.io/cloudant-sync-eap/cla/cla-corporate.pdf>`_

If you are an IBMer, please contact us directly as the contribution process is
slightly different.

Development Quickstart
======================

Clone the repo into a folder, set up a `virtual environment <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_, 
install the requirements:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git clone git@github.com:cloudant/python-cloudant.git
    $ cd python-cloudant
    $ virtualenv .
    $ ./bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -r test-requirements.txt
    
Before running the tests, start CouchDB:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ couchdb

The tests create databases in your CouchDB instance, these are `db-<uuid4()>`. 
They also create and delete documents in the `_replicator` database.

Now, run the tests. Here, I use the ``ADMIN_PARTY`` environment variable to
tell the tests not to use any authentication. See below for the full set of
variables that can be used.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ADMIN_PARTY=true nosetests -w ./tests/unit
    
There are several environment variables which affect
test behaviour:

- ``RUN_CLOUDANT_TESTS``: set this to run the tests that use Cloudant-specific features. If
  you set this, you must set one of the following combinations of other variables:
    - ``DB_URL``, ``DB_USER`` and ``DB_PASSWORD``.
    - ``CLOUDANT_ACCOUNT``, ``DB_USER`` and ``DB_PASSWORD``.
    - If you set both ``DB_URL`` and ``CLOUDANT_ACCOUNT``, ``DB_URL`` is used as the
      URL to make requests to and ``CLOUDANT_ACCOUNT`` is inserted into the ``X-Cloudant-User``
      header.
- Without ``RUN_CLOUDANT_TESTS``, the following environment variables have an effect:
    - Set ``DB_URL`` to set the root URL of the CouchDB/Cloudant instance. It defaults
      to ``http://localhost:5984``.
    - Set ``ADMIN_PARTY`` to ``true`` to not use any authentication details.
    - Without ``ADMIN_PARTY``, set ``DB_USER`` and ``DB_PASSWORD`` to use those
      credentials to access the database.
    - Without ``ADMIN_PARTY`` and ``DB_USER``, the tests assume CouchDB is in
      admin party mode, but create a user via ``_config`` to run tests as.
      This user is deleted at the end of the test run, but beware it'll 
      break other applications using the CouchDB instance that rely on
      admin party mode being in effect while the tests are running.
